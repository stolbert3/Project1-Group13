# Project1-Group13
PROJECT TITLE: Movie App

TEAM MEMBERS: Abdul Hameed, Dalton Ricker, Scott James Ritchey, Sydney Tolbert

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This program will search nearby movie theaters and showtimes and return the next movie playing in the user's area. There will be user input options for time constraints (less than three hours, out by 4:00pm, etc.), location restraints (within 5 miles, less than 20 minutes away, etc.) and possible calculation of travel time to the theater when making suggestions (if you leave in 5 minutes, you can make the X showing of Y theater). The user will also be given the option to create an account and rate movies as they see them to make movie suggestions more personalized.
